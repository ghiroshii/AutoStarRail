# AutoStar

A small automation for the game Honkai Star Rail that starts the farming of materials and relics in the game in a more automated way using the Pyautogui library


## Important warning
```bash
This tool has no intention of unbalancing or bringing undue advantage to whoever uses it, this tool only uses game mechanics and tries to automate a task without generating undue advantage, any user can do what this code does manually. 

This code is just an experiment in my initial study of the Python programming language and some libraries. I welcome tips and suggestions on how to improve.
```

## Installation

```bash
  pip install pyautogui
  pip install OpenCV 

```
